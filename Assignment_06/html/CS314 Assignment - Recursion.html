    Assignment 6: (Pair Assignment) </b>You <i><b>may</b></i> work with one 
other person on this assignment using the pair programming technique. <b>
<span style="background-color: #FFFF00">If you choose to work with a partner, you must 
work with someone in the same section as you. In other words you must have the

this 
<a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~scottm/cs314/handouts/Pair-Prog-CACM-1999.pdf" target="_blank">paper 
on pair programming</a>. You are <u><strong>not</strong></u> required to work in a pair on the 
assignment. (You may complete it by yourself if you wish.) If you begin working with one partner 
and decide to <strong>NOT</strong> finish the 
assignment with that partner you must complete the assignment individually. (You 
must both start over from scratch). If 
you work with a partner, the intent is that you work together, at the same 
computer. One person "drives" (does the typing and explains what they 
are doing) and the other person "navigates" (watches and asks questions when 
something is unclear). You <b>shall not</b> partition the work, work on your 
own, and then put things together. </p>

<p align="left" dir="ltr">You and your partner may not acquire from any source 
(e.g.&nbsp; another student or an internet site) a partial or complete solution 
to a problem or project that has been assigned. You and your partner may <b style="">not</b> show 
other students your 
    solution to an assignment. You <b>may <span style="">not</span></b> have another person 
    (current student other than your partner, former student, tutor, friend, anyone) “walk you through” 
    how to solve an assignment. You may get help from the instructional staff. 
You may discuss general ideas and approaches with other students. Review the 
<a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~scottm/cs314/syllabus.htm#Collaboration">class policy on collaboration 
    from the syllabus</a>. If you took CS314 in a previous semester and worked with a 
partner you must start from scratch on the assignment. Likewise, if you took 
CS314  in a previous semester and work with a partner this semester, you 
must start from scratch.</p>

<p>The purpose of this assignment is to practice writing and implementing recursive algorithms.
</p>
<p>In this assignment you will implement eight recursive methods. Some of the methods (1 - 3) use recursion to solve 
problems that could just as easily (if not more easily) be solved using simple 
iteration (for loops or while loops), but you solve them recursively for the 
practice.  </p>

<p>Some of

      the methods still need a

      normal loop like the recursive backtracking examples shown in class to 
make choices.

      (Such as the 
      <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~scottm/cs307/javacode/codeSamples/RecursionExampleDirectory.java">determining the space taken up by files</a> and the
      <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~scottm/cs307/javacode/codeSamples/EightQueens.java">N Queens</a> examples 
      done in class. Those were both examples of recursive backtracking that 
used for loops to iterate through choices at a certain point.) The 
tester code will be placed in a class named RecursiveTester.</p>

      <p>The provided file Recursive.java

      contains eight methods  to complete. For each method, clearly state the base case and&nbsp;recursive step for each

      method.</p>

      <p>The provided file RecursiveTester.java

      contains a number of tests of the methods in Recursive.java. Some of these 
      tests may be incorrect. Find and fix any incorrect tests. Your

      implementation of Recursive.java must pass these tests. Add at least 2 tests for each method other than carpet 
      method to RecursiveTester.java. (14 total tests) When you turn in the 
      file delete the provided tests and just include your tests.</p>

<p><b>Individual Problem Descriptions from Recursive.java:</b></p>

    <p align="LEFT"><u><b>1. Binary Conversion</b></u></p>

    <p align="LEFT"> <code>public String getBinary(int n)</code></p>

    <p align="LEFT">(Simple Recursion) Write a method to recursively creates a

    String that is the binary representation of an int N.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

    <p align="LEFT">Here is an example. The binary equivalent of 13 may be found

    by repeatedly dividing 13 by 2.&nbsp; If there is a remainder a 1 gets

    concatenated to the resulting String otherwise a zero gets concatenated to

    the resulting String. (The tricky part is figuring out the right time and 
    place to do

    the concatenation.)</p>

    <p align="LEFT">13 / 2 = 6 r 1<br>

    6 / 2 = 3 r 0<br>

    3 / 2 = 1 r 1<br>

    1 / 2 = 0 r 1<br>

    <br>

    13 in base 2 is 1101. The method returns the String "1101".</p>
<p align="LEFT"><u><b>2. Reversing a String</b></u></p>

    <p align="LEFT"> <code>public String revString(String target)</code></p>

    <p align="LEFT">(Simple Recursion) Write a recursive method that returns a 
    String that is the reverse of the input String. </p>

    <p class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;
mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">(It is acceptable to use 
	String concatenation in your answer. StringBuilder not required.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

    <p align="LEFT"><code>System.out.println( recursiveObject.revString("Calvin 
    and Hobbes"));</code></p>

    <p align="LEFT">would return a String equal to this: <code>"sebboH dna 
    nivlaC"</code></p>
<p align="LEFT"><u><b>3</b></u><b><u>. nextIsDouble</u></b><code><br>
    public int nextIsDouble(int[] data){</code></p>

    <p align="left">(Simple Recursion) This method returns the number of 
    elements in data that are followed directly by double that element. </p>
<p align="left">For 
    example, the given array <code>{1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256}</code> the 
    method would return 8. The elements 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, and 128 are all 
    followed directly by double their value.&nbsp; </p>
<p align="left">Given the array <code>{1, 3, 
    4, 2, 32, 8, 128, -5, 6}</code> the method would return 0. No element in the 
    array is followed directly by double that element.&nbsp; </p>
<p align="left">Given the array
    <code>{1, 0, 0, -5, -10, 32, 64, 128, 2, 9, 18}</code> the method would 
    return 5. The elements 0, -5, 32, 64 and 9 are all followed directly by 
    double their value. </p>

<p align="left">Write a helper method that is sent the array and the current 
    position or index in the array. That is where the actual recursion takes 
    place. The public method shown above simply kicks off the recursion.</p>
<p align="left"><u><b>4. Phone Mnemonics&nbsp; </b></u><code><br>
    public ArrayList&lt;String&gt;

    listMnemonics(String number)</code></p>

    <p align="left">(From <i>Thinking Recursively </i>by Eric Roberts.) On some 
    ancient telephone keypads the letters of the alphabet are mapped to various digits as shown

    in the picture below:</p>

    <p align="left">&nbsp; 
	<img border="0" src="./CS314 Assignment - Recursion_files/Recurs1.gif" width="327" height="444" alt="Layout of a classic phone pad with digits and the associate letters for each digit. [[1, 2(ABC), 3(DEF)], [4(GHI), 5(JKL), 6(MNO)], [7(PQRS), 8(TUV), 9(WXYZ)], [*, 0, #]] "></p>

    <p align="LEFT">In order to make their phone numbers more memorable, service 
    providers like to find numbers that spell out some word (called a <b>mnemonic</b>)

    appropriate to their business that makes that phone number easier to

    remember. (This was more valuable before the web and internet made it 
	possible to look up the number for almost every place of business there is.) For example, the phone number for a recorded time-of-day message

    in some localities is 637-8687 (NERVOUS). Write a method <font size="2">listMnemonics

    </font>that generate all possible letter combinations that correspond

    to a given number, represented as a string of digits. <b><i>This is a 
    recursive backtracking problem, but you are trying to find all the "solutions", not just one. 
    In fact, you are trying to find all possible Strings, not just Strings that 
    are actual "words".</i></b></p>

    <p align="LEFT">For example, if you

    call</p>

    <p align="LEFT"><code><font size="4">ArrayList&lt;String&gt; result =

    recursiveObject.listMnemonics("623")&nbsp;</font></code></p>

    <p align="LEFT">your method shall generate and return an ArrayList

    containing the following 27 possible letter combinations that correspond to

    that prefix:</p>

    <b>

    <p align="LEFT">MAD MBD MCD NAD NBD NCD OAD OBD OCD</p>

    <p align="LEFT">MAE MBE MCE NAE NBE NCE OAE OBE OCE</p>

    <p align="LEFT">MAF MBF MCF NAF NBF NCF OAF OBF OCF</p>

    </b>

    <p align="LEFT">Note, the Stings can be in any order in the ArrayList.</p>

    <p align="LEFT">Use the following helper method:</p>

    <p align="LEFT"><code>public String digitLetters(char ch)</code></p>

    <p align="LEFT">This method returns the letters associated with a given

    digit.</p>

    <p align="LEFT">Create a helper method that

    does most of the real work:</p>

    <p align="LEFT"><code>private void recursiveMnemonics(ArrayList&lt;String&gt; 
    result, String mnemonicSoFar, String digitsLeft)</code></p>

    <p align="LEFT">The ArrayList named result is used to store completed 
    mnemonics. mnemonicSoFar is the String that has been built up so far based 
    on various choices of letters for a digit. Initially it is the empty String. 
    digitsLeft consists of the digits from the original number that have not 
    been used so yet. Initially digitsLeft is the entire phone number. (Or 
    collection of digits.)</p>

    <p align="LEFT">To kick off the recursion you call method recursiveMnemonics from listMnemonics:</p>

    <p align="LEFT"><code>ArrayList&lt;String&gt; result = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;();<br>
    recursiveMnemonics(result, "", number);

    // when starting the mnemonic is the empty string<br>
    return result;</code></p>

- else (the length of the square must be greater than the limit value) divide 
the square into a 3 by 3 grid which will contain 9 sub squares. "Cut out" the 
middle square and then create a Sierpenski carpet in the 8 remaining sub 
squares.<br>

    static void drawSquares(Graphics g, int size, int limit, double x, double y)</code><br>
    <br>
    Use the fillRect method from the Graphics class. Here is 
    its signature.<br>
    <br>
    <code>fillRect(int x, int y, int width, int height) <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fills the specified rectangle.</code><br>
    <br>
    Recall point 0, 0 is at the top, left of the drawing panel and y increases 
    as you go down (not up).</p><p>Complete the following method:</p><p><code>
    public static void drawSquares(Graphics g, int size, int limit, double x, 
    double y){</code></p><p>Again, the x and y coordinates are passed as doubles. 
    When you call the fillRect method  cast the x and y coordinates to ints.</p><p>

    <p>&nbsp;Method <code>canFlowOffMap</code> has a parameter that represents a map 
    of elevations as 2D array of ints. It also has parameters that represent the 
    starting location of a drop of water on the map. 

    </p><ul>
      <li>The drop of water can move 
    to one of the four adjacent cells (above, below, left, and right of the 
    current cell)<b> if </b>the elevation in that cell is less than the elevation of 
    the current cell.

      </li>
      <li>Water in any cell on the edge of the map can flow off the map. 

      </li>
      <li>In other words, water in a cell on the border of the map is assumed to 
      be able to flow off the map regardless of the cells around it.

      </li>
      </ul>

    <p>In the first example, the plain, water in any cell not on the 
    border of the 2d array, cannot flow to any other cell because all adjacent 
    cells because all the elevations are the same. Water on any of the bordering 
    cells could flow off the map. In the second example if a drop of water 
    started at the cell at row 2, column 2 (the yellow cell with a value of 96) it could eventually flow off the map 
    by following the river. (Each segment of the river is one foot lower than 
    the previous.)&nbsp;

    </p><p>Recall that water on the border can also flow off. So, in the second 
    example if we started at the cell in row 3, column 0 (the red cell with a 
    value of 200) then we can flow off the map. The elevation in that cell is 
    200. The water can't flow to any of the other cells adjacent to it, but that 
    doesn't matter because that cell is on the border and so if start there I 
    can flow off the map. 

    </p><p>If the starting cell is row 3, column 1 (the blue cell with a value of 
    200), the water can flow off the map. That cell has an elevation of 200. The 
    water can't flow west or south because those cells are also at 200. But the 
    water can flow north or east to the cells in the river. (the water falls off 
    the bank into the river) and then off the map via the river. 

    </p><p>Finally, the cell at row 6, column 1 (the green cell with a value of 200) 
    can't flow off the map. It tries north and dead ends. It can't move east or 
    west. It can try south, but eventually dead ends. </p><p>When thinking about the problem it may help to think that 
    off the edge of border rows and columns is an infinitely deep canyon. So if 
    you are on a border of the map, (row 0 , column 0, last row, or last column) 
    then you can flow off the map. (Base case?)</p><p><code>canFlowOffMap</code> returns true if a drop of water starting 
    at the location specified by row, column can reach the edge of the map, 
    false otherwise.</p><p align="LEFT"><u><b>7. Creating fair teams.</b></u></p>

    <p align="LEFT"><code>public int minDifference(int numTeams, int[] 
	abilities) {</code></p>

    <p align="LEFT">In this question you are passed an int that represents the 
    number of teams we want to form from a group of people. You are also passed an array of ints that 
    represents the ability scores of all of the individuals we want to assign to 
    teams. (It could be athletic ability, IQ, artistic ability, etc.) Abilities 
    can be any integer value. A team's total ability is simply the sum of the 
    ability scores of the people assigned to that team.</p>

    <p align="LEFT">The goal of this method is to find the minimum possible 
    difference between the team with the maximum total ability and the team with the 
    minimum total ability. The constraints are everyone (represented by a value in the 
    array named abilities) must be placed on a team and every team must have at 
    least one member. </p>

    <p align="LEFT">You must create the helper method. You must keep track 
    of multiple things such as which element in the abilities array you are 
    currently considering (or which people have already been assigned to a team), what the total ability score is for each team, as 
    well as some way of ensuring each team has at least one member. (You could 
    simply track the number of members per team.)</p>

    <p align="LEFT">For example, if we have the following abilities: [1, 2, 3, 4, 
    5, 6, 7] and want to form three teams the min difference possible between 
    the team with the maximum total ability and the team with the minimum total 
    ability is 1. Your program does not need to show what the members of each 
    team are but, in this example, the minimum possible difference is created by 
    having 2 teams with a total ability of 9 and 1 team with 10. (min 9, max 
    10). There are multiple ways of doing this with these values one of which 
    is:<br>
    Team 1:&nbsp; 1 + 3 + 6 = 10<br>
    Team 2:&nbsp; 2 + 7 = 9<br>
    Team 3:&nbsp; 4 + 5 = 9</p>

    <p align="LEFT">In this problem there is a lot to do when you reach the base 
	case. You must ensure every team has at least one person on it (or it is an 
	invalid set up), and if it is a valid set up find the min and max team 
	ability scores. If the setup is invalid you must return some value to 
	indicate the set up was invalid or the largest possible difference. (Integer,MAX_VALUE 
    perhaps?) <b>HINT: 
    If not at the base case (all people assigned to teams), handle one person. 
    The choices for the current person are the teams they could be assigned to.</b></p>

<b>8</b><u><b>. MazeSolver</b></u></p><p>
<code>public int canEscapeMaze(char[][] maze)</code></p><p>Complete a method to determine if it is possible 
to escape a maze while collecting all of the coins scattered throughout the maze.</p><p>The maze is represented with a rectangular 2d array of chars. 
Each element of the 2d array is a cell and the maze has 6 types of cells:</p><ul>
	<li>Starting cell: The Starting cell is marked with an S. There is only one 
	Starting cell in the maze. The starting cell becomes a green cell after we 
	leave it.</li>
	<li>Impassable cells. Impassable cells are marked with an asterisk, *. We 
	may not enter impassable cells.</li>
	<li>Green cells. Green cells are marked initially with a G. When we leave a 
	green cell, it becomes a yellow cell as described below.</li>
	<li>Yellow cells. Yellow cells are marked initially with a Y. When we leave 
	a yellow cell, it becomes an impassable cell as described above.</li>
	<li>Money cells. Gold cells are marked with a $. Each money cell contains a 
	single gold coin we will pick up as we travel through the maze. There is no 
	limit to the number of coins we can pick up. When we leave a money cell it 
	becomes a yellow cell as described above.</li>
	<li>Exit cells. Exit cells are marked with an E. If we can reach an Exit 
	cell we can escape the maze. Exit cells may appear any where in the maze, 
	not just on the edges. There may me multiple exit cells in the maze. When we 
	step into an Exit cell, we exit the maze due to being teleported out. In 
	other words, we can't pass through an exit cell to another cell in the maze.</li>
</ul>
<p>The 2d array of chars represents a bird's eye view of the maze. We can move 
up, down, left, or right, but not diagonally in the maze. Your method shall 
return 2 if we can reach an exit cell in the maze after collection all the gold 
coins present, a 1 if we can reach an exit in the maze but without collecting 
all the gold coins, or a 0 if it is not possible to exit the maze at all.</p>
<p>Consider the following simple maze:<br></p>
<p>G$SGE</p>
<p>&nbsp;We start at the cell marked with an S. We move to the left one spot 
to the cell with the gold coin. We then move back to the right to our starting 
cell, to the right once more to the regular cell and then right to the exit. 
Given this maze our method shall return 2.</p><p>Consider the following maze:</p><p>$Y$SGE</p><p>We can't escape this maze while collecting all the gold coins. 
We can move left to pick up the first coin. When we move left again to the 
yellow cell. When we leave that cell it becomes impassable. ($*YGGE) We can get 
to the gold coin on the far left, but we are stuck there and can't exit the 
maze. We can exit the maze without picking up all the coins so the method shall, 
in this case, return 1.
